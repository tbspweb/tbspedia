# Hobart Chalet

;WHO:  All active patrol members (patrollers and candidates) are allowed to stay at the Chalet during the patrol season, including weekdays, for $5/night per person.  No deposit is required.  The fees will pay for Chalet supplies and phone, and also some snacks and drinks available to all patrollers visiting the Chalet.  Inactive patrollers and non-TBSP guests will be allowed to use the Chalet as they have in the past, but must be hosted by an active patroller during their entire visit.

;WHERE:  From I-80 in Truckee, go north on Hwy. 89.  Proceed on 89N approximately 5 miles just past Hobart Mills.  About 0.35mi past the turnoff to Hobart Mills, turn left into the Hobart Work Center (there is a small Forest Service sign for HWC).  Continue straight on this road for a couple 100 yards or so to a group of mobile buildings/trailers and sheds on your right.  This is the Hobart Work Center.  Park in the lot in front of the buildings.  The Operations Center is the closest of the 3 grouped buildings from the parking lot, and the Chalet is directly in behind it. The driveway off 89 will be plowed, but can be icy for weeks after a storm.  USFS maintenance personnel will clear a path to the chalet and to the TBSP pod.

;THE DETAILS:  There are 5 bedrooms, each has two beds. There are two bathrooms.  There are 4 refrigerators, two stoves, and several sinks.  The heat is all electric or natural gas (no wood stove).  TBSP will provide a TBSP phone (no long distance), and a TBSP answering machine.  There is cable TV and there is usually a DVD player available for our use.  The Operations Center (identical layout to the Chalet) will also be available to us for additional accommodations, however itâ€™s likely that NO WATER SUPPLY will be available there.  Users of these barracks will need to use facilities in the Chalet.

;CHALET RULES & RESERVATIONS:  Please read carefully and understand the current draft of Chalet Rules agreed upon by TBSP and the Forest Service.  A copy may be found in the Chalet Logbook.  Everyone staying at the Chalet must do at least one chore. ADVANCE RESERVATIONS ARE REQUIRED FOR ALL WEEKNIGHT VISITS and are suggested for weekends, especially on training weekends.  Use the google documents to sign up in advance.
