# In-Service Training
For most of us, the On-Hill Refresher was not only a great refresher, but a chance to build a list in our heads of the skills we need a little more practice on.  Tt has always been our intent that patrol days are also training opportunities, and this year we want to make it a little more official and organized to make sure that we, as a patrol, use the many learning opportunities the winter provides to continue transferring our personal lists of “skills we need a little more practice on” into “skills we are competent in.”  

The general recommendation is that 45 minutes to 1 hour of every Patrol day should be spent training or refreshing
specific skills, to be agreed upon before heading out for patrol.

## Planning ahead
In the future, you will notice that part of the email reminder telling you about your patrol days will also solicit requests for skills each patroller would like to practice.  The mountain manager will compile these and report to the team leaders what skills seem most requested.  The team leader will then be responsible for making sure skill practice happens while out on patrol.  Some skills may involve more “re-learning” while others may purely be practice.  Whatever the need, the hope is that as a group the patrol team will be able to teach each other.  

## Recording your training
Your patrol report should mention the skills practiced in the "Coomments" section.  

# List of Skills
Here are some examples of skills to practice. Feel free to edit this wiki page and add things to this list!

  * Setting up the rope kits
  * Practicing beacon searches
  * Orienteering
  * OEC scenarios
  * Multiple Beacon/Multiple Rescuer Avy Searchs (Equipment required: bury tubes and F1s)
  * Radio Skills
  * Emergency sled assembly

As the year progresses, we will, hopefully, also be able to put together a bank of skill cards that give a prepared format for practicing a skill.  For example, a route finding exercise with coordinates and directions of how to orienteer to them (compass, sighting etc.) or an in depth OEC scenarios.  Developing a skill card is also an option for the skill practiced on a patrol day (especially setting up orienteering scenarios!)
