The patrol director, in turn, will be accountable for the actions of these appointed officers.

        1. Section C: Committees

Additionally, the board of directors may call special meetings as needed. Except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, all meetings of the Patrol will be conducted pursuant to the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order. Minutes of all meetings of the general membership and board of directors must be recorded and filed in a permanent binder to be stored in the Patrol's equipment shed.

      1. Article VII: Elections
        1. Section A: Qualifications for Election
To be eligible for the office of patrol director, an individual must be a patroller and must have been a member in good standing with the Patrol for at least two years, not counting the candidate year. To be eligible for one of the six positions on the board of directors, an individual must have been a member in good standing of the Patrol for at least one year. An individual who is nominated for any position must agree to run and to serve if elected. All members of the Patrol, except candidates, will be eligible for appointed offices without regard to patrol status designation.

        1. Section B: Nominations for Election
On or before February 1 of each year, the chairperson of the board of directors will appoint a nominating committee consisting of three Patrol members. The nominating committee, working with appropriate input from the general membership, will select one appropriate, qualified candidate for each office about to be vacant. The nominees will be selected based on the majority decision of the nominating committee. No member of the nominating committee may be considered for nomination. The name of any candidate nominated for patrol director shall be submitted to area management before the election ballot is prepared.

        1. Section C: Notification or Nominations
When the committee has selected its candidates and the candidates have indicated their willingness to stand for election and to serve if elected, the nominating committee will announce its recommendations in the Patrol newsletter, or by a special mailing to Patrol members. This announcement must be made on or before April of each year.

        1. Section D: Nominations from the Floor
Additional nominations will be accepted from qualified Patrol members between April and April 15. Nominees not recommended by the nominating committee must accept or reject the nomination and must meet all qualifications for the office for which they have been nominated.

        1. Section E: Elections
The registrar shall conduct all elections by mail. On or about May 1 of each year the registrar shall forward a written ballot to each qualified member. These ballots shall be numbered to assure validity. Members shall have until May 15 to mark and return their ballots to the registrar. Ballots postmarked after May 15 shall not be valid. On or about May 20 the registrar will count the ballots and report the results to the chairperson of the board. The ballots will be retained until the board is sure that the general membership is satisfied with the count. A simple majority of the votes cast will be sufficient to .win an office where a single position is at stake (i.e., patrol director). Where the election is for more than one equal office (i.e., seats on the board of directors), the candidates receiving the highest numbers of votes, consistent with the number of seats available, will be deemed the winners.

        1. Section F: Quorum
At least 30 percent of the total membership will constitute a quorum for the purposes of electing officers or transacting other routine business.

        1. Section G: Qualifications to Vote
All members of the Patrol, except candidates, will be eligible to vote.

        1. Section H: Voting Procedures
In cases where there is no contest, the chairperson of the board will rule that the election is by acclamation. In cases of contested elections, all voting will be done by secret written ballot. In the event of a tie vote, the registrar will immediately order a run-off vote between the tied candidates. The run-off will be done by secret written ballot. A newly elected patrol director or board member will assume office on June 1.


      1. Article VIII: Financial Administration
        1. Section A: Dues
To exist as an organization, the Patrol has certain financial requirements that must be met by membership fees and various fundraising activities. To be considered a member in good standing able to vote in elections and take advantage of membership privileges, a member must pay all required dues by the date established each year by the patrol director and the treasurer of the board of directors. This date will be announced to the members in the early fall edition of the Patrol newsletter. The amount of dues will be established by the board of directors. These dues will be added to the national, division, and region assessments, and each member will be given a breakdown of the amount that goes to the national level and to each subunit of the organization. Every member will pay the total of all dues in one lump sum, and every member will pay the same amount of dues.

        1. Section B: Fiscal Year
The fiscal year of the Patrol will be October 1 through September 30. The treasurer of the board of directors, as the chief financial officer of the Patrol, must prepare a comprehensive, end-of-year financial statement for presentation to the general membership at the annual fall meeting.

The financial records of the Patrol must be available for formal audit by other higher NSP bodies as required, and for review by any voting member upon 20 days prior request. Should the Patrol be dissolved, all funds remaining in the treasury will pass to the National Ski Patrol.

      1. Article IX: Amendments
These bylaws may be amended at any general membership meeting upon at least two weeks prior written notice to the membership. Such notice will include the original bylaw wording, proposed changes, reasons for the changes, and the date when the matter will be voted upon. Amendments may be proposed in writing to the board of directors by any Patrol member. Amendments must be accompanied by a petition signed by at least 5 Patrol members and must be presented to the general membership for consideration. A two-thirds majority of the qualified voting Patrol members who attend the meeting and vote on the amendment will be sufficient to carry the amendment. Where more than one bylaw amendment is presented, each amendment must be considered separately, unless there is unanimous agreement by those voting to the contrary.
