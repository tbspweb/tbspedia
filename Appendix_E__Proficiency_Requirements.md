# Appendix E: Proficiency Requirements

    *PROFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS**
Candidates or transferring patrollers are expected to demonstrate proficiency in the following skill areas before they will be registered as basic Nordic patrollers: 
 
    1. Skiing/Snowboarding Skills
Skiing Skills: Proficiency to an intermediate level (good balance with consistent smoothness and reasonable efficiency and confidence) in each of the following aspects of Nordic skiing: 
  1. Level travel: sound diagonal stride with good kick & glide using single pole technique; 
  1. Uphill travel on a moderate slope using all of the following techniques: diagonal stride, herringbone, climbing traverse with kick turns, and sidestepping; 
  1. Downhill travel on a moderate slope using sidestepping and sideslipping; 
  1. Downhill travel on a moderate slope using traverse ending in a stop; 
  1. Downhill travel on a moderate slope using telemark, step, stem, or skate turns; 
  1. Straight downhill running on a moderate slope, controlling speed by snowplow; 
  1. Straight downhill run on a moderate slope. Candidate must show stability and confidence; and 
  1. Travel across varied terrain over a considerable distance to demonstrate the stamina and moderate speed necessary for patrolling. 

Skiing ability will be rated throughout the period of candidacy and tested on a specific day. In situations where the Patrol Director is uncertain whether a candidate has developed the necessary skiing skills, the candidate will be asked to obtain private instruction at the candidate's expense. Each skiing skill must be learned to a reasonable proficiency, but we don't require advanced levels in any aspect of skiing. 

Snowboarding Skills: Proficiency to a strong intermediate to advanced level of backcountry snowboarding is required. Specific skills are being developed. In the interim, proficiency will be judged on a case-by-case basis by experienced backcountry snowboarders in the patrol. Proficiency requirements parallel the levels indicated for skiing.
