# TBSP Outreach

# Outline for TBSP Outreach Events
TBSP is partnering with the Tahoe Rim Trail Association and the Forest
Service at Tahoe Meadows on select Saturdays in February and March to
provide an overview of fun safe backcountry travel. It is typically a
20 to 30 minute talk on backcountry safety and preparedness for novice
backcountry travelers after which the Humboldt-Toiyabe ranger Steve
Hale or George Kerr will take the participants on a short
snowshoe tour and the patrol heads off to patrol the Tahoe Meadows area.

The outreach starts at 9:45 at the west end of Tahoe Meadows (the long straightaway on the Mt Rose Hwy).
Parking is on either side of the road, and the event is designated by a large
FS banner. Don't forget to bring the TBSP banner!

Your forest service contact may be standing away from the road, so be 
especially attentive if the snowbanks are large. More information about 
these outreach events can be found at the Tahoe Rim Trails Association
