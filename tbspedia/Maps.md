      1. GPS Topo Maps
Do you have a Garmin GPS?

"A very detailed (20ft contours) topographic map that includes roads and water features and a few trails as well for the entire state of California. This is a release of Laura's map that allows for a MapSource install so older Garmin units can use the maps and so it can be combined with other maps." http://www.gpsfiledepot.com/maps/view/28/

Several internet resources offer pre-made topographic maps of California. These maps are built from freely available USGS Hydrological and topographic surveys. This link provides 1:24000 topo maps for all of california: http://www.gpsfiledepot.com/maps/view/28/
