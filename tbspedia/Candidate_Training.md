The candidate training season is a major time commitment. 

OEC Candidates have a 15 day commitment their first year.  Non-OEC candidates have a 14 day commitment.  These days are a mix of classroom and field training days, and days out shadowing our normal patrols. Candidates will be able to sign up for these shadow patrol days on our website tbsp.org after Nov 21, 2011. Candidates who have NSP MTR experience or AIARE or NSP Avalanache Level 1 certification can challenge some of the training days.

The commitment for a full patroller is 8 days per season. 

      1. OEC Candidates
For candidates who complete the National Ski Patrol's Outdoor Emergency Care before their candidate season, the candidate year is 15 days.  Candidates become full patrollers at the end of this season with completion of the final.  Training days consist of 4 Candidate Patrols, a three-day Basic Mountain Travel and Rescue course (1 classroom, 2 overnight field), a three-day Basic Avalanche for the Professional Rescuer (1 classroom, 2 field days),  one OEC Skills clinic, and four days out shadowing our normal patrols.
