# Mountain Manager

    1. Mountain Manager Responsibilities
The online system is set up to only allow drops if there are more than three patrollers signed up for the day. With fewer than three patrollers, it's at the discretion of the mountain manager. The Mountain Manager can use the "mountain manager tools" section of the web page to drop a patroller from a day on the schedule. Ideally, the patroller would find a replacement and then be able to drop the day by themselves.

Alternatively, the MM can mark the patroller as a "no-show" on the patrol report and annotate that the no-show was pre-arranged.
