# Chapter 07: U.S. Forest Service Support



    1. U.S. FOREST SERVICE SUPPORT
The TBSP is sponsored by the USFS, and we support them with other activities at their request, such as:  
  * Snowmobile closure sign posting - under the direction of USFS (Materials and equipment provided by USFS)  Snowmobile closure area "enforcement". We report closure violations to dispatch, and by providing visual reports.  
  * Census of users: especially at Tahoe Meadows (as indicated on the Patrol Report)  
  * Public outreach

Each year, TBSP renews its agreements with the Tahoe National Forest and the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forests. TBSP operates under the following documents:
  * FS-1800-8 Agreement for Sponsored Volunteer Services
  * Annual Operations Plan
  * Job Hazard Analysis and Evacuation Plan
  * This Patrol Manual

The TBSP Volunteer Agreements can be found at [docs.tbsp.org](http://docs.tbsp.org) under "Documents and Forms".
