# Scheduling

# Patrol Schedule
Tahoe Backcountry Ski Patrol is active on weekends and holidays from December through April.
Scheduling for the patrol season is done via lottery prior to the start of the season.

## Patrol Credit rules
The following days are required for Patrollers:
  1. A minimum of eight Patrol days, including one day at Boreal
  1. Attendance at the Operations Refresher
  1. Attendance at an OEC Refresher

The following days count as patrol days:
  1. On-the-Hill Refresher (select session A or session B) counts as one day (Instructors and Students)
  1. Each patrol instructor day counts as one day, except overnights, which together count as two days
  1. Participation as an instructor in Avalanche or Mountaineering classes does count.
  1. For OEC Instructors, Instruction at TBSP candidate OEC clinics or evaluations counts
  1. Participation as a student in Avalanche or Mountaineering classes does NOT count
  1. Participation as a student in non-OEC candidate training counts as one day (overnights only count as one day)
  1. Participation as a student in OEC Clinics or Evaluations is required of candidates, but does not count
  1. Boreal patrol Ski-Along (patrollers, candidates w/OEC) counts as one day
  1. You need permission of the patrol director to act as a patrol instructor

## Minimum Patrol Size
The minimum size for a patrol is one full patroller and one qualified candidate. 
Candidate qualifications are to be determined by the Mountain Manager. The team leader can also 
make this distinction.

## Missed Days
If you cannot make a patrol day, you are obligated to find someone to substitute for you.

## Cancelled Patrols
It is very rare for patrols to be cancelled -- usually these days are when we are needed most!
If you are part of a patrol which is cancelled, that patrol day still counts towards your patrol requirement.
Cancellations are at the discretion of the Mountain Manager.
