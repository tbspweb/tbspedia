      1. Release Notes
Welcome to Beacon: Helping you find your information! This online utility is designed to help you patrol the "electronic backcountry," allowing you to manage your own contact information and patrol schedules, provide single-sign-on access to TBSPedia and the TBSP's document management system, and to manage Patrol Reports and attendance tracking.

An integral part of the patrol report filing process, Beacon allows easy indexing and access to PDF versions of our Patrol Reports, and gives mountain managers a powerful tool for recording events. Beacon also integrates integrated mailing list and automatic Patrol Reminder emails.

Get started now by uploading your photo and checking to make sure your patrol schedule is correct! This is the BETA release of Beacon, so there are sure to be bugs. Please use the link at the bottom-right hand corner of each page to report bugs.
