[Grover](thumb|right|200x140px|John)(Image:JohnGrover.jpg.md) *Returning Candidate*
<br>John been backcountry splitboarding for 2 years now and started as a way to try to keep fit in the winter, to find the best conditions and to get away from the resort crowds. One of his peak b/c experiences: "It was a long day on Jakes Peak last year. We were actually on our way to Tallac after a storm and got turned around by a road closure at emerald bay. I wasn't expecting much, and was blown away by the awesome conditions, the view and the fun terrain." When not skiing/boarding, John can be found mountain bike riding, chasing his two year old boy around and running his Berkeley-based IT consulting firm (Endsight, Inc). John anticipates getting more experience and backcountry knowledge and to meet great like minded people who enjoy getting out and earning their turns (safely).

    1. Lia Heath
[Heath](thumb|right|200x140px|Lia)(Image:LiaHeath.jpg.md) *Returning Candidate*
<br>Lia grew up skiing the resorts in Tahoe; nowadays she's looking to spend more time out of bounds. Introduced to AT on a trip with some co-workers to Tioga Pass, she immediately fell in love with it. Her "peak" experience was a 4-day trip to the Wallowa mountains "where it didn't stop blowing rain/slush/wet snow the entire time. It was absolutely miserable conditions, but forced everyone to test their limits and made for hours of backcountry stories to follow." Lia has her dream job working as Women's Sportwear Clothing Designer at The North Face. And when not at work, "I'm biking, visiting with my family, randomly organizing things, watching reality tv (did I just say that?), or counting my pennies for my next vacation with my husband." Lia is looking forward to learning new skills, giving back to the outdoor community, and meeting cool new people.'''

    1. Mike Krueger
  *Returning Candidate*
<br> <br>Why TBSP? "While climbing Mt Shasta one season I met a guide that was a big back Country skier who liked to climb up and ski down. I thought it was a great idea, no one likes descending a mountain on foot, so I joined him on a climb and ski on Christmas day. It was one of those days you only see in a Warren Miller film. We were 11,000 ft up dropping into a bowl. Three feet of new untracked snow, no one around, and clear sky. Up and down three times. It was love at first turn.

When I am not skiing, you can find me with my wife either on the water, unfrozen snow, kayaking and sailing or training a group of Breast Cancer Survivors to climb mountains.

The one thing I would like to get out of TBSP will be to have the experience level in the backcountry to feel confident in taking my wife back there with me. Actually, maybe it is her feeling comfortable following me."

    1. Adam Richardson
  *Returning Candidate*

<br>As a winemaker for a fast-paced vineyard in Livermore, and accustomed to the spacious natural landscape of his native Australia, Adam soon tired of the same runs and crowded slopes. He became sick of making excuses not to go out backcountry instead of easy ‘ lifted’ options. When not skiing with a free heel, Adam can be found freeing his mind with his digeridoo talents. Adam was drawn to TBSP to gain backcountry skills and meet laidback ski people.

<br> 

    1. Andrea Fajans
[Fajans](thumb|right|200x140px|Andrea)(Image:AndreaFajans.jpg.md) 
  *Returning Candidate*

<br>Andrea grew up cross country and downhill skiing and loves being in the backcountry so backcountry skiing was the next logical step. One of her peak backcountry experiences is the month spent in the mountains of India backpacking and mountaineering. When not skiing, Andrea can be found on a run or with a book and a cup of tea. About her previous year in TBSP Andrea says, "TBSP has already contributed more backcountry knowledge and experience to me which is all I can really ask for."

<br> <br> 

    1. Brooke Babineau
  *Returning Candidate *
<br> <br>Brooke deeply believes in being in the backcountry because, "snow is fun and there's lots of snow back there." When not skiing Brooke can be found assisting on neurosurgery at UC Davis in an attempt to find an answer to her life's work on autism. When feeling lazy she prefers to watch sports on TV. One thing Brook would like to get out of TBSP is gaining skills to help the less coordinated people in her life (Tom!) and those on the trails.

<br> <br> 

    1. Thomas McBride
[McBride](200x140px|thumb|right|Tom)(Image:ThomasMcBride.jpg.md)
  *Returning Candidate*

<br>Tom was turned onto backcountry skiing during a trip hiking to and skiing Tuckerman Ravine on Mt. Washington, NH. When he’s skiing Tom can be found “hiking or rock climbing, or hiking to a climb”. This season he is hoping to gain knowledge/ experience to be safer and have more fun in the backcountry, not to mention lots of fun days on the snow.

<br> <br> <br> 

    1. Matt Eccles
  *Returning Candidate*

<br>Joining TBSP is a part of goal, 15 years in the making, to get better at backcountry skiing. Matt enjoys b/c skiing, but with three young kids it’s difficult to make the time. In addition to being "forced" to get out there and learning new skills, Matt also looks forward to skiing with other safe BC skier. Sitting all day at a desk as a bond broker in<br>San Francisco, Matt has also realized his navigation and map reading skills have been on the decline. And so with TBSP help, he'll not only be a safer b/c skier, he'll be able to find his car again at the end of a workday.

    1. Cynthia Dohl

  *New Candidate*

<br>Cindy’s entrance into backcountry skiing just kind of happened when she and a friend one day “started doing it”. She went on to have many great experiences after that and one of her peak experiences was going to Europe and doing La Haute Route for her 50th birthday. When not skiing Cindy can be found teaching French, traveling to Switzerland, teaching skiing, and making some kind of dessert to give to someone (if you’re nice to her maybe it can be you!). Her goal with TBSP this year is to meet new friends to be with in the backcountry.

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 

    1. Leslie Keil
[Keil](200x140px|thumb|right|Leslie)(Image:LeslieKeil.jpg.md)
  *New Candidate (Non-OEC)*

<br>If you see Leslie driving by in her Audi, make sure you get out of her way because, as her license plate holder says, this girl will “race you to the snow”. Leslie is new to the backcountry this year, and looking to experience some snow country quiet. No stranger to speed, in the summer time you can find Leslie screaming up and down the Delta in her family's boat "Not da Mama", usually with a knee boarder in toe! This season Leslie is looking forward to picking up lifelong mountain and rescue skills and acquiring a standing excuse to explore the backcountry.

<br> <br> 

    1. Chad Taylor
[Taylor](200x140px|thumb|right|Chad)(Image:ChadTaylor.JPG.md)
  *New Candidate (Non-OEC)*

<br>Chad was initially attracted to backcountry skiing by the potential to ride bigger lines, but soon realized that the freedom of the backcountry is far more attractive, and of course “the ridiculous snow”. On of his peak experiences was hiking the peaks around Las Lenas. When not in the backcountry Chad can be found playing a competitive game of scrabble, wishing the Buffalo Sabres would win a stanley cup and spending time with girlfriend Kelly. This season Chad would like to get out of TBSP more knowledge of the Tahoe backcountry, and some new friends.

    1. Dave Vargas
[Vargas](200x140px|thumb|right|Dave)(Image:DaveVargas.JPG.md)
  *New Candidate* 

<br>“I grew up in Mt. Shasta so I have been walking up stuff to slide down since I was pretty young. I really had gotten away from skiing and getting out in the backcountry in general during the late 90's but have really gotten back into it since 2000. Something that is the best every time it happens is when I get a friend out there for the first time and they can't believe how awesome the turns are when you've earned 'em.”

When not skiing/boarding Dave likes to build stuff, “mostly stuff it would be easier to just go out and buy”, but just like skiing, it’s better when you earn it!

This season Dave’s goal is to meet a larger group of people who love the back country and travel in it safely. He’d also like to hone existing skills and gain new ones in order to be better equipped when taking people out for the first time.

    1. Zac Weiner
[Weiner](140x200px|thumb|right|Zac)(Image:ZacWeiner.jpg.md)
  *Transfer Candidate*

<br>Zac decided to join the TBSP because he likes the idea of something a little less corporate and a little more relaxing than a ski resort. The extra exercise doesn’t hurt either! When he’s not skiing Zac can be found sailing, climbing, racing his road bike, taking pictures, playing the piano, backpacking, or going to the symphony. Zac works as an EMT, teaches EMT school, and is a student at UC Berkeley. This season with TBSP Zac would like to gain new friends and new skills.

    1. Michael McGroarty
[McGroarty](200x140px|thumb|right|Mike)(Image:MichaelMcGroarty.jpg.md)
  *New Candidate*

<br>Michael got turned onto backcountry skiing because of some great summer backpacking trips in the Sierras. He learned that less people and no terrain parks make for a very enjoyable experience. Michael says that when not skiing, “I reluctantly admit to snowboarding on occasion”. He can also be found playing any sport other than golf, primarily triathlon, mountain biking, rock climbing, wakeboarding, and hiking. This season with TBSP Michael would like to gain some mountaineering/ winter backcountry skills.

    1. Barry Luck
[Luck](140x200px|thumb|right|Barry)(Image:BarryLuck.jpg.md)
  *New Candidate (Non-OEC)*

<br>Barry was turned onto backcountry by some people that he worked with at Porter's Ski and Sport in Truckee. His first backcountry experience was the Lake Run from Sugarbowl. Barry enjoys the backcountry because it provided the chance to experience this little section of the Sierras in any season. Barry says, “Every time I've gone out, I've just really enjoyed being out with friends, relaxing, riding however I feel and being able to choose any part of a mountain to ride.”

A peak backcountry experience… “From the top of my head, one peak experience that stands out was a day a friend and I were on top of Donner Summit on a beautiful day with a ton of snow. This was in early spring of '95 or '96 and it was all sunshine out. We were just hanging out, taking pics of each other dropping off the east walls and enjoying the scenery. Something about that moment in time stands out. Maybe it was standing on top of the summit, trying to get my freakin' out under control, but it was also really peaceful.”

When not in the backcountry, Barry can be found doing/playing anything that he feels is fun, healthy and positive. This season Barry hopes to gain skills to confidently and safely introduce friends to the joys of being in the backcountry.
