# Patrol Reminder

%% COMMENT Automatically becomes the Patrol Reminder. Lines which begin with two # characters are MACROS %%

Dear Patrollers,
You are scheduled to patrol on the following dates. Meeting time is usually 08:15
at the TBSP Shed, Tahoe Truckee Airport, but you are encouraged to contact your 
fellow patrollers early to start making a plan for the weekend. Use the handy email
aliases below, or contact thisweek@tbsp.org

The thisweek@tbsp.org is subscribed to Sierra Avalanche Center
reports for the Tahoe basin. This means that for the week leading up to your patrol,
you will receive SAC reports, even if you're not personally subscribed the list.
Be safe! This is a safety and best practices thing, so please don't try and unsubscribe.
(Unsubscribing wont work anyway...) Mail will only arrive while you are scheduled to patrol!

PATROL REPORTS: 
 Use the above link to start your patrol report **before** you start your patrol! 
 We ask you to start your patrol report prior to patrolling so you have a chance
 to document your patrol-plan so we have an accurate roster and location plan for
 each patrol in the field.

PATROL GEAR:
 Patrol gear is stored at the TBSP Shed at the Tahoe-Truckee Airport.
 Please contact Pete Beaupre if you need directions/access information
 for the shed.

INREACH:
 Remember to check in at the trailhead by sending an "IN-SERVICE" preset message on the inReach, 
 and an "OUT-OF-SERVICE" preset message at the end of the day. 
 Messages will be copied to the Mountain Manager and thisweek@tbsp.org
